// The leveloffset causes level 1 sections (a single =) 
// to be interpreted as level 2 sections. This enables 
// each chapter to be built alone as a "book" or 
// included in the main book, enabling html-single to preserve old bookmarks
// Only use it for proper chapters, not preface or appendix
